**Developed a chrome-extension for a Company notice board as a part of HVA hackathon.**
Problem:The notice board in the office, to display all the information about the company goes unnoticed. Some employees work from home and they miss it. 
Proposed Solution:Build a chrome extension to set the Homepage of the browser as our notice board.

Widgets Added:
-> Google Slide
-> Pomodoro Timer
-> Spotify Music 
-> Google Spreadsheet
-> Google form
-> Floating Emoji
